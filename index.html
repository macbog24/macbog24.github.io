                        I strive to make healthcare more efficient and more effective by constantly pursuing dynamic opportunities to solve healthcare's most challenging problems. My goal is to always continue learning, improving, and evolving.<br><br>I am interested in applying advanced analytics and statistics to improve healthcare from the perspective of the patient and the provider by solving problems such as delays in patient care, patient misclassification, interoperability, staffing optimization, and more. In particular, I want to leverage statistical modeling and machine learning in healthcare to augment human intelligence and allow physicians to optimize patient care.  <br><br>At IBM, I have leveraged advanced analytics to create various solutions in the healthcare and life sciences industries. I worked on a demand forecasting platform using supervised learning algorithms to forecast the impact of new biosimilars hitting the market for a multinational biotechnology company where we achieved unit forecasts with 94% accuracy using 30+ analytical features across 4,000+ accounts. I built a cognitive evidence gathering solution for a multinational medical device corporation to identify the required evidence for new Medical Device Regulations. I was one of two data scientists to configure an end-to-end solution for an enterprise level initiative to automate the prior-authorization process and generate standardized output with criteria level decisions and applicable evidence while designing and implementing a scalable and HIPAA compliant architecture on AWS. We increased the speed of the prior-authorization process by 2,600x, increased total accuracy to 91%, and increased daily throughput by 329x.  As the project expanded across multiple business units, I took on a leadership role to help the new data scientists get up to speed, led communications between the technical team and the clinical team, and continued to ensure quality and clinically accurate code was being delivered.

                        <h3>Examining the Impact of Education on Diabetes Rates</h3>
                        <p>
                            Diabetes rates are a problem of growing concern in the U.S. Over 30 million people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with diabetes, and over 90 percent of that group has the largely preventable type 2 diabetes. In order to thwart the disease that costs the U.S. $245 billion a year, the populations most susceptible to diabetes need to be identified and educated. Using data from MEPS, education and several other factors have been identified and their relationships with diabetes have been analyzed to target at risk populations and outline tactics to educate those in dire need of preventative care.
